BACKEND DEVELOPMENT DOCUMENTATION FOR LINKEDIN APP

 ## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
Welcome to the LinkedIn App Backend Development project! This repository contains the backend code for a simplified version of a LinkedIn-like social networking platform.The backend is implemented using Java programming language and  SQL for database management .The primary goal of this project is to provide a robust backend infrastructure that supports user authentication, profile management, and connection features.

## BACK-END
- __JAVA__

  Java as the Backend Language:
  The LinkedIn app backend is built using Java, leveraging its robust and scalable features to handle user authentication, profile 
  management, and networking functionalities.The use of Java in the backend ensures an expressive and maintainable codebase, 
  allowing for efficient development, easy collaboration, and seamless integration of additional features in the LinkedIn app.
  
- __MYSQL__
  
  Mysql as the Backend Database:
  The project utilizes MySQL as its relational database management system, ensuring reliable data storage and retrieval for user profiles, 
  connections, and other essential functionalities of the LinkedIn app backend.Leveraging the scalability and efficiency of MySQL, the 
  backend seamlessly manages user data, providing a robust foundation for the LinkedIn app to scale with growing user interactions and 
  networking activities.

## SPRING BOOT FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

Spring Boot is the core framework used for building the backend of this project. It provides a rapid development environment for creating stand-alone, production-grade Spring-based applications.

## POSTMAN
Postman is utilized for testing and documenting the APIs developed in the Spring Boot application. It allows for easy creation and execution of HTTP requests, as well as the generation of API documentation.
